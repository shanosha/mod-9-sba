## Reflections

- How I implemented React and TypeScript features.
- I utilized props and callback functions to transmit data between components. I utilized useState to track state varilables and form inputs. I used useEffect to toggle a class in the body tag.

- The challenges I encountered and how I overcame them.
- One challenge was deciding the organization of cantent and how to extract certain functionality into my taskUtils file.

- Your approach to component composition and state management.
- I composed components to useState minimally, only tracking it when needed.
